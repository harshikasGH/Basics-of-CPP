"Hello World" & "Simple Calculator" in C++

Aim
This repository contains two introductory C++ programs:

- **Hello World**: Displays a welcome message on the console.
- **Simple Calculator**: Performs basic arithmetic operations based on user input.

Theory
C++ is a high-performance, general-purpose programming language derived from C. Developed by **Bjarne Stroustrup** in the early 1980s at **Bell Labs**, C++ supports both procedural and object-oriented programming paradigms. It is widely used for system software, game development, and cross-platform applications.

This experiment introduces two essential tasks:

1. **Printing "Hello World"** – the classic starting point for learning any programming language.
2. **Building a Simple Calculator** – a hands-on exercise in user input, arithmetic operations, and control flow.

Part A: Hello World
- Uses the `cout` function from the `<iostream>` library to display output.
- The directive `using namespace std;` allows direct access to standard functions without prefixing them with `std::`.

Part B: Simple Calculator
- Accepts two numerical inputs from the user.
- Performs one of the following operations based on user choice:
  - ➕ Addition (`+`)
  - ➖ Subtraction (`-`)
  - ✖️ Multiplication (`*`)
  - ➗ Division (`/`)
- Uses `cin` for input and `cout` for output.
- Applies control flow (`if-else` or `switch`) to execute the selected operation.

Conclusion
These foundational programs introduce core **C++ syntax**, **input/output operations**, and **logical control structures** in a hands-on way:

- **"Hello World"** marks the entry point into console-based applications.
- **Calculator** demonstrates user interaction, arithmetic processing, and decision-making.

Together, they build a strong starting point for deeper programming exploration. 🚀
